## Libraries Used

[ws](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws) - For creating WebSocket API on the server side.

## Learnings

1. WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.
2. it's bi-directional i.e. the client and server both can send messages to each other.
3. It's used when we require to show Real-Time data to the user without the page getting refreshed.
